### Vehicle Loan Default Prediction
# Project Overview
Financial institutions frequently suffer substantial losses due to vehicle loan defaults. To mitigate these losses, they often tighten their vehicle loan underwriting processes, resulting in increased rejection rates for applicants. To address this issue and improve the credit risk assessment process, there is a need for a more accurate credit scoring model that can predict vehicle loan defaults. This capstone project, part of my data analytics program, aims to estimate the factors that contribute to vehicle loan defaults and leverage these insights to create a predictive model for identifying potential defaulters.

# Dataset
We are working with a dataset that contains 41 attributes related to vehicle loan applications and their outcomes. This dataset will serve as the foundation for our analysis and model development.

# Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

+ Identify and analyze the key factors that influence the likelihood of vehicle loan defaults.
+ Develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast potential loan defaulters based on the identified factors.
+ Provide insights and recommendations to financial institutions for improving their loan approval processes and reducing default rates.

By addressing these objectives, we aim to assist financial institutions in making more informed decisions when approving vehicle loan applications, ultimately reducing the risks associated with defaults and optimizing their lending practices.


# Key Deliverables
+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the characteristics of the data, treating missing values, and handling outliers.
+ Feature Selection & Importance Analysis: Identifying the primary factors contributing to loan defaults.
+ Model Development: Using logistic regression to build a predictive model for identifying potential defaulters.
+ Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy.
